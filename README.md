# 👋 Hi, I'm Sunil Kumar

Welcome to my GitHub. This space reflects my work and interests in **Credit Risk Modeling**, **Fraud Analytics**, and **Data Science for Risk Management**.

I hold a Master’s in Business Analytics and specialize in designing data-driven solutions that support credit decisioning, fraud prevention, and regulatory compliance. My focus is on building interpretable, scalable, and production-ready models that align with real-world risk strategies and policy frameworks.

## 🎯 Areas of Focus

- **Credit Risk Modeling**: PD (Probability of Default), LGD (Loss Given Default), EAD (Exposure at Default)  
- **Scorecard Development**: WOE/IV transformation, binning, logistic regression, reject inference  
- **Model Monitoring & Validation**: Stability Index (PSI), Discrimination (Gini, KS), Calibration, Backtesting  
- **Risk-Based Segmentation**: Behavioral modeling, risk banding, exposure analysis  
- **Fraud Analytics**: First-party fraud, synthetic identity detection, rule-based and ML-driven fraud systems  
- **Regulatory Alignment**: Basel II/III compliance, IFRS 9 modeling components  
- **Responsible AI & Model Governance**: Fairness, explainability (LIME, SHAP), regulatory audit readiness  
- **NLP in Risk**: Text classification and named entity recognition for legal, policy, and financial documents
