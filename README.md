# 👋 Hi, I'm Sunil Kumar

Welcome to my GitHub! 

This space reflects my work and interests in **Data Science**, **Business Analytics**, and **Applied Machine Learning** across domains such as **BFSI**, **E-commerce**, and **Retail**.

I hold a Master’s in Business Analytics and specialize in designing **data-driven solutions** that enable organizations to make informed, scalable, and interpretable decisions. My work focuses on **turning complex data into actionable insights** while ensuring models are aligned with real-world strategies, policies, and business objectives.

## 🎯 Areas of Focus

- **Predictive Modeling & Forecasting**: Customer behavior, demand forecasting, credit/loan performance, churn analysis
- **Segmentation & Personalization**: Customer profiling, clustering, and recommendation systems
- **Risk & Fraud Analytics**: Anomaly detection, rule-based and ML-driven fraud prevention
- **Model Monitoring & Governance**: Performance tracking, fairness, explainability (LIME, SHAP), regulatory alignment
- **NLP Applications**: Text classification, sentiment analysis, document intelligence for financial, retail, and e-commerce data
- **Business Intelligence**: Dashboards, KPI tracking, operational efficiency analytics
